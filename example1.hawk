'A' in binary is 01000001 so we need to flip the bits at position 1 and position 7

>          First clear the pool (optional)
/^         Move the pointer left one bit and flip that bit
//////^    Move the pointer left six more bits and flip the last bit
:>         Print out the pool (A) and clear the pool


The following can also be written like this

>/^//////^:>

(That will also print 'A')
